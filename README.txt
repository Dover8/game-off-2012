"Lerpz" model taken from the Unity3D "2DGamePlayTutorialProject" available from the Unity3D website. 
As the project is similar to the design of my game, for ease I kept most of the scripts attached to the model (all the .js in the project), but made a few modifications

Ufo model taken from a 1st year University project I did

Crate & Barrel models from the Industrial Props Pack by RUBE from the Unity Asset Store
